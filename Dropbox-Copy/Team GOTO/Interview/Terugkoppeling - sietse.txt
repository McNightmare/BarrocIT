Dear dhr. van de Hoek,
 
I send you this mail in following our conversation last time (11-09-2014) where we've talked about the application that communicate between the departments
me and my team have good espectations for the progress of the project. here are the main points we've talked about:

- everbody should have access to the application, and they only need one account
-it's not costumers specific, the lower one is actually project specific. 
-our department should be able to put all work on done, not suspended.

we hope that everything is allright. 


sincerely,

Rudyard Meijsen
Project manager
Team GOTO (Ricky van den Berg, Steven Logghe en Rudyard Meijsen)
