ProjectBoundries

The Project is started at monday 8 sept. and the deadline is at monday 3 nov. so we've only 5 weeks before the deadline.
if we're getting behind, then we need more effort to keep up. en thus we'll have lesser rest.
we're not going to add additional functions if they don't need to be in the application. else we may have not enough time to finish the main goal of the project.
since we've already the laptops and programs we need. we don't have any additional costs for the project. (except food to give us alive)
if one(or multiple) of the teammates are absent, than we'll try to reach each other through skype, and so bringing data and information to each other.

Products:
The first product we made is The Plan of approach, so you know what the project is all about, 
Then we've a planning, to make priority what needs to be first to make and what needs to be last
in the planning stands also a design or prototype, so we know how the design of our final product looks like
there are also the rapports and the final product, which is the product where everything was all about.

Risks:
Intern Risks:
We've only 5 weeks the time, we we don't spend our time well, then there's a change that the project won't be done at time.
extern Risks:
the projectBoundries are obvious and we're not dependant from other projects, so far we know, we don't have extern risks.
